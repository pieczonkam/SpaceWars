# SpaceWars
This repository contains code of the game I made for my BSc Thesis: "Using the Unity tools and the Unity engine to create a computer game".

The game can be played or downloaded here: https://m3rez.itch.io/spacewars

Space Wars is a space shooter created with Unity. It's made of a few levels in which your goal is to kill all enemies. You can collect coins which add up to your final score and power ups to boost your weapon. The game has one-player and two-players modes.
